Hey guys, Jack Wang here! I'm a junior student in UTSEUS. As one of Mr.Lunde's students, I'm so honored that I could contribute to the podcast project! I'm really hyped up. Also, I'm a huge basketball lover and like listening to podcasts as well. Hopefully, we will have a great time here with all the friendly people. Finally, wish you luck every single day.

Hi everyone, I am one of the cohosts on this site, an information engineering student from UTSEUS who is responsible for interviewing guests and running the site.

I enjoy interviewing and networking, learning about the stories and experiences of people from all walks of life as I interact with them. I am passionate about computer science and technology and love to explore new technologies and solve technical challenges.

Thank you for your support and interest, and let's build a quality podcast and website together to bring more value and fun to our listeners!

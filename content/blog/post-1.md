### Contents of the interview
Interviewer: Hello everyone, welcome to our podcast. Today we're thrilled to have Dr. Lisa Lee, a materials science engineer with over 10 years of experience. She is currently working as a Research Manager at a leading materials science company. Dr. Lee, thank you for joining us today.

Dr. Lee: Thank you for having me.

Interviewer: To get started, could you tell us a little bit about your journey to becoming a materials science engineer?

Dr. Lee: Sure. In college, I was very interested in chemistry and physics, but I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do with those interests. After taking a materials science course, I realized that it was the perfect combination of my interests, as it involved the synthesis, processing, and characterization of a wide range of materials. This led me to pursue a PhD in materials science, and from there, I started my career in industry.

Interviewer: That's fascinating. Can you tell us about a project that you have worked on that you are particularly proud of?

Dr. Lee: One project that stands out to me was developing a new polymer for use in solar panels. We were able to create a polymer that had a higher power conversion efficiency than any other polymer that was currently being used in solar panels. It was a long process, as we had to optimize the polymer's properties and work with a team to incorporate it into the final solar panel design. But when we finally saw the results, it was incredibly rewarding.

Interviewer: That sounds exciting. How do you see materials science engineering evolving in the next decade?

Dr. Lee: One trend that I see is the increased use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in materials science research. This technology allows us to rapidly screen and predict the properties of new materials, which can greatly speed up the materials discovery process. Additionally, I believe we will continue to see more sustainable materials being developed, as there is increasing pressure to create materials that have a lower environmental impact.

Interviewer: Thank you for your insights. Lastly, what advice would you give to someone who is interested in pursuing a career in materials science engineering?

Dr. Lee: I would encourage them to take a variety of courses in chemistry, physics, and materials science, as those subjects provide the foundational knowledge needed to pursue a career in materials science engineering. Additionally, I would recommend seeking out research opportunities, as hands-on experience is invaluable in this field. Finally, I would encourage them to stay curious and be open to learning new things, as materials science engineering is a constantly evolving field with new discoveries and techniques emerging all the time.

Interviewer: Thank you so much, Dr. Lee, for sharing your insights and experiences with us. It was truly inspiring to learn more about your work in materials science engineering.

Dr. Lee: Thank you for having me, it was a pleasure to be here.

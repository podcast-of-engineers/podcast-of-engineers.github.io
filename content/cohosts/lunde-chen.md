Hi, I'm Lunde Chen. I'm an assistant professor in compuster science at UTSEUS, Shanghai University. I graduated from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China, with a master's degree in computer science in 2014, before my Ph.D study at the University of Toulouse (INSA de Toulouse), France, from 2015 to 2019. I enjoy listening to podcasts very much and that's why I launched The Podcast of Engineers with my students, for which I am also a co-host. To learn more about me, please visit: http://lunde.top.

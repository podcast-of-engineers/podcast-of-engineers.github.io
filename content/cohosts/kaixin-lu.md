Hello, my name is Kaixin Lu, and I am also one of the co-hosts of this site. I am now a student in UTSEUS and will go to Duke University for my graduate study.

Podcast, without seeing people directly but still making contact with them, makes this kind of communication style more interesting. Hoping to enjoy the time we spend together!

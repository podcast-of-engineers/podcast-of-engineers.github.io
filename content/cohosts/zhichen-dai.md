Hi! My name is Zhicheng Dai, a student at UTSEUS, Shanghai University. I am deeply passionate about studying technology, particularly in the fields of computer science (CS) and electrical engineering (EE).

Beyond my technical pursuits, I find great fulfillment in connecting with individuals from diverse disciplines and varying value systems. Engaging in genuine conversations with such people brings me immense joy. Not only do their experiences and perspectives often provide fresh insights for my own life and learning, but it is also the profound connection that forms between our souls that truly enriches the experience.

If you feel the same, please join us!

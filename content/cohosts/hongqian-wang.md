Hello everyone, I am a co-host and coordinator of this platform and a major student from UTSEUS.

I love reading and believe that books are windows of knowledge through which I can continuously expand my horizons. I also enjoy interacting with a variety of people, each with their own unique stories and experiences that I love to listen to and learn from.

Thinking is a habit for me and I enjoy exploring various problems and challenges and trying to find innovative solutions. Whether in the technical field or in all aspects of life, I am full of passion and hope to continue to learn and grow.

Thank you for your support and attention, let us work together to create high-quality content and bring more value and fun to our listeners!

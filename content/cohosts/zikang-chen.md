Hi! My name is Zikang. I'm currently pursuing my engineering master's degree in engineering in France, following my graduation from UTSEUS, Shanghai University, where I was honored with the Principal's Scholarship, placing me in the top 0.2% of students. 

I'm proud to be a recipient of the Meritorious Winner Award in the prestigious international Mathematical Contest in Modeling/Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM), positioning me in the top 0.2% of competitors globally. 

In addition, I contribute as a developer to an open-source community and write blogs focusing on technology and investment insights. 

I'm always open to engaging in discussions. Feel free to connect with me!

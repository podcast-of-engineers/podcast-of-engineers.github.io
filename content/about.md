Welcome to "The Podcast of Engineers," where we invite you to join us for insightful conversations with engineers from diverse industries and backgrounds, along with former engineers, CEOs, managers, and professors.

Our goal is to uncover the stories, experiences, challenges, and successes of engineers who are making a difference in the world today. 

From robotics to aerospace, civil engineering to computer science, and everything in between, our guests share their unique perspectives on their work, their engineering journey, and the profound influence their innovations have on society.

Co-hosted by passionate engineering enthusiasts, many of whom are students and aspiring engineers from [UTSEUS (Université de Technologie Sino Européenne de Shanghai), Shanghai University](https://utseus.shu.edu.cn/en.htm), this podcast seeks to inspire and enlighten students in China and across the globe about the exciting and ever-evolving world of engineering. 

We firmly believe that engineering devoid of humanity lacks soul. Hence, humanity is at the heart of our podcast. Our vision encompasses a sustainable, healthy, secure, connected, and creative humanity. To achieve this vision, engineers should be equipped with multicultural and multidisciplinary knowledge and perspectives. That's why we propose this podcast in three languages: Chinese <iconify-icon icon="twemoji:flag-for-flag-china" style="scale:1.0"></iconify-icon>, French <iconify-icon icon="twemoji:flag-for-flag-france" style="scale:1.0"></iconify-icon>  and English <iconify-icon icon="twemoji:flag-united-states" style="scale:1.0"></iconify-icon> <iconify-icon icon="twemoji:flag-united-kingdom"></iconify-icon>, and that's also why our discussions can be expansive and thought-provoking, touching on diverse topics such as literature, philosophy, history, languages, art, ecology, fitness, psychology, mindfulness, spirituality, social science, and more.

Join us on this journey and gain a new appreciation for the critical role engineers play in shaping our world. Together, let's embrace engineering with a human touch and drive positive changes for a brighter future.
